For changing these,\n     * use the function `Crafty.paths`.\n     *\n     * Files with suffixes in `imageWhitelist` (case insensitive) will be loaded.\n     *\n     * It's possible to pass the full file path(including protocol), instead of just the filename.ext, in case\n     * you want some asset to be loaded from another domain.\n     *\n     * If `Crafty.support.audio` is `true`, files with the following suffixes `mp3`, `wav`, `ogg` and\n     * `mp4` (case insensitive) can be loaded.\n     *\n     * The `onProgress` function will be passed on object with information about\n     * the progress including how many assets loaded, total of all the assets to\n     * load and a percentage of the progress.\n     * ~~~\n     * { loaded: j, total: total, percent: (j / total * 100), src:src }\n     * ~~~\n     *\n     * `onError` will be passed with the asset that couldn't load.\n     *\n     * When `onError` is not provided, the onLoad is loaded even when some assets are not successfully loaded.\n     * Otherwise, onLoad will be called no matter whether there are errors or not.\n     *\n     * @example\n     * ~~~\n     * var assetsObj = {\n     *     \"audio\": {\n     *         \"beep\": [\"beep.wav\", \"beep.mp3\", \"beep.ogg\"],\n     *         \"boop\": \"boop.wav\",\n     *         \"slash\": \"slash.wav\"\n     *     },\n     *     \"images\": [\"badguy.bmp\", \"goodguy.png\"],\n     *     \"sprites\": {\n     *         \"animals.png\": {\n     *             \"tile\": 50,\n     *             \"tileh\": 40,\n     *             \"map\": { \"ladybug\": [0,0], \"lazycat\": [0,1], \"ferociousdog\": [0,2] }\n     *             \"paddingX\": 5,\n     *             \"paddingY\": 5,\n     *             \"paddingAroundBorder\": 10\n     *         },\n     *         \"vehicles.png\": {\n     *             \"tile\": 150,\n     *             \"tileh\": 75,\n     *             \"map\": { \"car\": [0,0], \"truck\": [0,1] }\n     *         }\n     *     },\n     * };\n     *\n     * Crafty.load(assetsObj, // preload assets\n     *     function() { //when loaded\n     *         Crafty.scene(\"main\"); //go to main scene\n     *         Crafty.audio.play(\"boop\"); //Play the audio file\n     *         Crafty.e('2D, DOM, lazycat'); // create entity with sprite\n     *     },\n     *\n     *     function(e) { //progress\n     *     },\n     *\n     *     function(e) { //uh oh, error loading\n     *     }\n     * );\n     * ~~~\n     *\n     * @see Crafty.paths\n     * @see Crafty.assets\n     * @see Crafty.imageWhitelist\n     * @see Crafty.removeAssets\n     */\n    load: function(data, oncomplete, onprogress, onerror) {\n        if (Array.isArray(data)) {\n            Crafty.log(\n                \"Calling Crafty.load with an array of assets no longer works; see the docs for more details.\"\n            );\n            return;\n        }\n\n        data = typeof data === \"string\" ?

(Layer scale will be scale^scaleResponse.)\n     *   z: 0 // The zIndex of the layer relative to other layers\n     * }\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Crafty will automatically define three built-in layers: \"DefaultDOMLayer\", DefaultCanvasLayer\",  and \"DefaultWebGLLayer\".\n     * They will have `z` values of `30`, `20`, and `10` respectively, and will be initialized if a \"DOM\", \"Canvas\" or \"WebGL\" component\n     * is used with an entity not attached to any user-specified layer.\n     *\n     * @note Layers are implemented as systems, so the layer name must be distinct from other systems.\n     *\n     * @note By default, layers will persist across scene changes.  You can manually clean up a layer by removing all it's entities and then destroying it.\n     *\n     * @example\n     * ```\n     * Crafty.createLayer(\"MyCanvasLayer\", \"Canvas\")\n     * Crafty.e(\"2D, MyCanvasLayer, Color\");\n     * ```\n     * Define a custom canvas layer, then create an entity that uses the custom layer to render.\n     *\n     * @example\n     * ```\n     * Crafty.createLayer(\"UILayer\", \"DOM\", {scaleResponse: 0, xResponse: 0, yResponse: 0})\n     * Crafty.e(\"2D, UILayer, Text\");\n     * ```\n     * Define a custom DOM layer that will not move with the camera.

- when mouse is scrolled - MouseWheelEvent\n *\n * The event callback is triggered with a native [`wheel` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/wheel) (all newer browsers),\n * a native [`mousewheel` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mousewheel) (old IE and WebKit browsers) or\n * a native [`DOMMouseScroll` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/DOMMouseScroll) (old Firefox browsers)\n * received by Crafty's stage (`Crafty.stage.elem`), which is wrapped in a standard Crafty event object (see below).\n *\n * These MouseWheel events are triggered on the global Crafty object and thus on every entity and system.\n *\n * The standard `MouseWheelEvent` object:\n * ~~~\n * // event name of mouse wheel event - \"MouseWheelScroll\"\n * e.eventName\n *\n * // the direction the wheel was scrolled, +1 if wheel was scrolled up, -1 if wheel was scrolled down\n * e.direction\n *\n * // the closest (visible & Mouse-enhanced) entity to the source of the event (if available), otherwise null\n * e.target\n *\n * // (x,y) coordinates of mouse event in world (default viewport) space\n * e.realX\n * e.realY\n *\n * // Original mouse wheel event, containing additional native properties\n * e.originalEvent\n * ~~~\n *\n * @example\n * Zoom the viewport (camera) in response to mouse scroll events.\n * ~~~\n * Crafty.bind(\"MouseWheelScroll\", function(evt) {\n *     Crafty.viewport.scale(Crafty.viewport._scale * (1 + evt.direction * 0.1));\n * });\n * ~~~\n *\n * For more details see [mdn article on wheel events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/wheel#Listening_to_this_event_across_browser).\n * @note The wheel delta properties of the event vary in magnitude across browsers, thus it is recommended to check for `.direction` instead.\n * The `.direction` equals `+1` if wheel was scrolled up, `-1` if wheel was scrolled down\n * (see [details](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5527601/normalizing-mousewheel-speed-across-browsers)).\n *\n * @example\n * Interactive, map-like zooming of the viewport (camera) in response to mouse scroll events.\n * ~~~\n * // sign public void zoomTowards(Number amt, Number posX, Number posY, Number time[, String|function easingFn])\n * // param Number amt - amount to zoom in on the target by (eg. `2`, `4`, `0.5`)\n * // param Number posX - the x coordinate to zoom towards\n * // param Number posY - the y coordinate to zoom towards\n * // param Number time - the duration in ms of the entire zoom operation\n * // param easingFn - A string or custom function specifying an easing.\n * //                   (Defaults to linear behavior.)\n * //                   See `Crafty.easing` for more information.\n * //\n * // Zooms the camera towards a given point, preserving the current center.\n * // `amt > 1` will bring the camera closer to the subject,\n * // `amt < 1` will bring it farther away,\n * // `amt = 0` will reset to the default zoom level.\n * // Zooming is multiplicative. To reset the zoom amount, pass `0`.\n * //\n * // <example>\n * // // Make the entities appear twice as large by zooming in towards (100,100) over the duration of 3 seconds using linear easing behavior\n * // zoomTowards(2, 100, 100, 3000);\n * // </example>\n * //\n * function zoomTowards (amt, posX, posY, time, easingFn) {\n *     var scale = Crafty.viewport._scale,\n *         // current viewport center\n *         centX = -Crafty.viewport._x + Crafty.viewport._width / 2 / scale,\n *         centY = -Crafty.viewport._y + Crafty.viewport._height / 2 / scale,\n *         // direction vector from viewport center to position\n *         deltaX = posX - centX,\n *         deltaY = posY - centY;\n *     var f = amt - 1;\n *\n *     Crafty.viewport.zoom(amt, centX + deltaX * f, centY + deltaY * f, time, easingFn);\n * }\n *\n * // don't restrict panning of viewport in any way\n * Crafty.viewport.clampToEntities = false;\n *\n * // enable panning of viewport by dragging the mouse\n * Crafty.viewport.mouselook(true);\n *\n * // enable interactive map-like zooming by scrolling the mouse\n * Crafty.bind(\"MouseWheelScroll\", function (evt) {\n *     zoomTowards(1 + evt.direction/10, evt.realX, evt.realY, 5);\n * });\n * ~~~\n */\n\nCrafty.s(\n    \"MouseWheel\",\n    Crafty.extend.call(new Crafty.__eventDispatcher(), {\n        _evt: {\n            // evt object to reuse\n            eventName: \"\",\n            direction: 0,\n            target: null,\n            clientX: 0, // DEPRECATED: remove in upcoming release\n            clientY: 0, // DEPRECATED: remove in upcoming release\n            realX: 0,\n            realY: 0,\n            originalEvent: null\n        },\n        _mouseSystem: null,\n\n        prepareEvent: function(e) {\n            var mouseSystem = this._mouseSystem;\n            if (!mouseSystem)\n                this._mouseSystem = mouseSystem = Crafty.s(\"Mouse\");\n\n            var evt = this._evt;\n\n            // normalize eventName\n            evt.eventName = \"MouseWheelScroll\";\n\n            // normalize direction\n            evt.direction =\n                e.detail < 0 || e.wheelDelta > 0 || e.deltaY < 0 ? 1 : -1;\n\n            // copy screen coordinates\n            // only browsers supporting `wheel` event contain mouse coordinates\n            // DEPRECATED: remove in upcoming release\n            evt.clientX =\n                e.clientX !== undefined\n                    ? e.clientX\n                    : mouseSystem.lastMouseEvent.clientX;\n            evt.clientY =\n                e.clientY !== undefined\n                    ? e.clientY\n                    : mouseSystem.lastMouseEvent.clientY;\n\n            // augment mouse event with real coordinates\n            Crafty.translatePointerEventCoordinates(e, evt);\n\n            // augment mouse event with target entity\n            evt.target = mouseSystem.mouseObjs\n                ?
